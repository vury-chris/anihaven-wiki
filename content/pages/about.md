# About AniHaven

## Our lore!

### How it started.
The [AniHaven Community Server](https://discord.anihaven.site/) was created and currently managed by @vuryex or "chris" and began as **Nerd Haven** on February, 2025. The original purpose of the community server was to both act as a support server for the once public Discord bot, "Hae-In", an anime-based game bot with various types of games and features. The Discord bot had an Anime card collecting game, Basic and Advanced moderation features, an economy system, leveling system, any much more. The server grew to about 25-ish members and the bot had joined roughly 20 servers after the first 2 weeks, but was then shut down and was purged due to early burnout and lack of activity. Exams were coming up so managing and hosting the bot became an inconvenient task for what it was as the community was still tiny.

### A new run.
After about a 2.5 month break, shelved our focus on the Discord bot and went to focus more on a community-based platform on Discord. We started advertising the server again through Disboard and got some decent traction. That’s when we launched our Minecraft SMP server to give people something fun to do together. The peak player count was around 5-6 online at once. Not exactly breaking records, but it was fun and a great time to get to know eachother.

### Building an ecosystem.
As of now the ecosystem is quite small. The AniHaven Ecosystem currently consists of a Discord Server, Discord Bot, [Website](https://anihaven.site/), and Community Wiki Page. We plan to expand even further and hope to build a team of high quality gaming enthusiasts to aid in the creation of more tools for our community to use. In the near future we plan on re-releasing our Discord Bot, "AniQuery" as a handy tool for anime community Discord servers. We are developing useful Discord tools to help increase user experience and convenience and we’re also planning on putting out feet into Minecraft modding—things like custom mods, modpacks, server plugins, and resource packs—both to make the SMP server more fun and to share with others who want to use them on their own.

We plan on making AniHaven more than just **another** Discord server where people can chat with others. What we want is for AniHaven be a place that matters, a culture, a place where people can relate, grow as people, look for a better user experience, and have fun. We want you to feel welcome here, whether you want to chat, contribute to community projects, or lurk.



- There honestly isn't much to write so I had to stretch it out to make it look interesting. I honestly enjoy doing this and I hope to see this community grow
